S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

--> Object based Storage : store the flat file : mp3,mp4,video,images... 

Block based Storage : Install the OS : EBS, Instance Store
Network attached storage : Storage over the network : EFS , FSx


--> Unlimited storage available
--> S3 is a global platform, DOesn't required any region selection.
--> Softlimit : 100 buckets
--> Buckets : Dir/Folder
--> We store all the objects in S3 buckets.
--> We need to choose a region when creating a bucket.
--> Min Obj Size : 0 bytes, Max Obj size : 5 TB
Bucket name : Must be unique across the globe. (should comply with DNS naming standards)
--> Min CHar : 3, Max Char: 63
--> Should not contains any Uppercase letter/ 
--> should not resemble IP address format
--> Should not start with . , should not end with . , No adjesent ..

--> Pay-as-you-go
--> No Pre-provisioning required

100 gb data

10gb Frequently accessed, Data should be available immediately
10gb lessFreq Accesed data, Data should be available immediately
20gb Non-Mission critical data, reprodusable data.. 
20gb Archieve, not required immediately

S3-Standard : Frequently accessed, Default storage on s3 platform. 
99.99% Avia, 99.999999999% Durability

Standard-IA / OneZone-IA : lessFreq Accesed data, Data should be available immediately

GLacier / Glacier Deep Archieve : To archieve data for lobger durations.. Data will not be available immediately.. We need to retive the data to access.

RRS : Reduced Redundancy Storage : Durability : 99.99%, Nonmission critical data, easily reprodusable data.. 

Intelligent tier : We can choose if we are not sure about our access patterns.

Versioning : 
____________

--> Backup option on our s3 bucket.
--> Once enabled, cannot disable, We can suspend if required.
--> If we delete Latest version (Version : Hide), We will get the Delete marker,

--> Set "version : Show" , delete any of the object version. We will not get Delete Marker.

____________

--> Same Region replication is newly introduced feature. Please correct this in material.
--> Versioning must be enabled on source bucket and destination bucket.
